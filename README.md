# Odin Recipes

*"One small step me... urrr umm... one giant step for me!"*

This is such a simple project and yet here I am incredibly proud of my 
1996-level allrecipes.com copy-pasta!

I've had an interest in programming for years now. I've long dreamed of
making my own audio plugins (yes, I'm an audio geek unfortunately), but
any attempt to try and dabble in learning C++ (the, from what I 
understand, de facto DSP standard) through app-based solutions, left me
unsatisfied and frustrated. Not to mention I'm now 40 years old, and
have now become extremely doubtful that my ever becoming proficient
enough in C++ to make a plugin is anywhere close to being realistic.

That however has not quelled my thirst and interest in learning to
code or to program. Like so many other people though, the next and
undoubtedly obvious question became equally frustrating: "If I'm
going to learn anything, what should I learn?". Enter The Odin Project.

I'm almost positive I had heard mention of it on Reddit somewhere in
the past. But it wasn't until these last few weeks that the urge and
drive had reached a boiling point. I just had to learn *something*.
I should have bookmarked the exact post so I could thank that person.
In any case, it's probably too early to thank anybody... I'm still at
the very beginning of my journey!

Up to this point, I've come to feel quite confident in my extremely
rudimentary skills, lol. It's satisfying, and I am just hopeful that,
with any luck, I can look back at this README in a few months from now
and crack a smile!

In the last three days, I've spent north of 30 hours coming to grips
with not only all the motivational/mindset portion of the course
(which is absolutely inspiring by the way), but the basics of how to 
use GIT, setting up a virtual machine with Linux, using the command
line, building up the muscle memory of how to write boiler plate HTML
and all the rest of it!

To everybody who's contributed to The Odin Project, I am extremely
thankful and hope to one day be a contributor!

Cheers,

A.B.
